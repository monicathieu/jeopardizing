The labor-intensive cake is traditionally made by brushing cake batter onto a spit rotated over a fire to cook the cake layer by layer.

By the 1700s the chalumeau became a popular classical instrument in Germany, where woodwind makers experimented with reshaping the instrument to improve its tone and increase its range. These changes eventually produced the modern clarinet, which rendered the chalumeau obsolete.","The Verneuil process is one of the oldest methods for synthesizing gemstones, developed in 1902 by French chemist Auguste Verneuil. Powdered ingredients are sifted onto a very hot flame, where they fuse together and then drip down onto a base, where they solidify into crystal. Usually used to synthesize corundum, the Verneuil process is also known as the flame fusion process, because the flame is necessary to fuse the ingredients into crystal.","By 1000 CE, horse armor in the Islamic empires of central Asia was primarily metal.
