They use a component called a thermal flasher, which has two pieces of steel that change shape when heated or cooled. Together, these pieces switch the current to the turn signals on and off periodically.","Turn signals in cars don't need computers to flash their lights.

Because they were exempt from sumptuary laws that required people to dress according to social class, the Landsknecht often wore very showy clothing in bright colors. Serving not only in Germany, they were hired by clients as far away as the Grand Duke of Florence in modern-day Italy.","While its exact origin is unclear, the modern kazoo appeared in the United States in the late 1800s. The kazoo likely descended from a similar African instrument made of eggshell membrane stretched across the end of a cow's horn. These instruments are members of the mirliton family, which comprises all instruments emitting a ""buzzy"" sound from an air-vibrated membrane.","Pleochroism can only occur in gems with asymmetry in their crystal structure. Gems with a cubic crystal system, which is totally symmetrical, thus cannot be pleochroic. This can differentiate gems of the same color but with different crystal structures. For example, ruby and spinel have historically been set interchangeably in jewelry because they are the same shade of red. With a dichroscope, trigonal ruby, which is slightly pleochroic, can be distinguished from cubic spinel, which shows one color from all angles.","Landsknecht were fearsome German pike-wielding mercenaries fighting battles for hire in the early 1500s.
