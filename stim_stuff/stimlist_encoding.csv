Gems with a cubic crystal system, which is totally symmetrical, thus cannot be pleochroic. This can differentiate gems of the same color but with different crystal structures. For example, ruby and spinel have historically been set interchangeably in jewelry because they are the same shade of red. With a dichroscope, trigonal ruby, which is slightly pleochroic, can be distinguished from cubic spinel, which shows one color from all angles.","Landsknecht were fearsome German pike-wielding mercenaries fighting battles for hire in the early 1500s. Because they were exempt from sumptuary laws that required people to dress according to social class, the Landsknecht often wore very showy clothing in bright colors. Serving not only in Germany, they were hired by clients as far away as the Grand Duke of Florence in modern-day Italy.","While its exact origin is unclear, the modern kazoo appeared in the United States in the late 1800s. The kazoo likely descended from a similar African instrument made of eggshell membrane stretched across the end of a cow's horn. These instruments are members of the mirliton family, which comprises all instruments emitting a ""buzzy"" sound from an air-vibrated membrane.","Pleochroism can only occur in gems with asymmetry in their crystal structure.

The vocoder was originally developed by Bell Labs to encrypt voice messages sent during World War II. By the 1970s the vocoder was eventually co-opted by musicians to make synthesizer tones sound like human speech, and it is now used almost exclusively as a musical instrument.","Many gemstones are not ""solid"", but instead contain inclusions of other crystals, or perhaps bubbles of some other liquid or gas. Certain crystal inclusions increase the beauty (and price) of a gem, but inclusions like gas bubbles are a red flag for synthetic stones, and thus can decrease gem value.

The contact patch is the spot on the bottom of each tire that is flat against the road. If a car is overloaded, or its tires are underinflated, the contact patch under each tire will be larger.","When a car sits on its tires, the tires are not completely round, but instead are pushed into the ground by the weight of the car.

Cope originally reconstructed it with the head attached to the short end of the spine, leaving a very long tail and what he believed were unique ""reversed"" vertebrae. When he invited Marsh to see his fossil, Marsh realized that Cope had placed the head on the end of the tail instead of the neck, embarrassing Cope and possibly starting their long rivalry.","Elasmosaurus was the first plesiosaur identified in the United States, documented by Edward Drinker Cope in 1868.

memorise,77,academic,39,"By 1000 CE, horse armor in the Islamic empires of central Asia was primarily metal. One component of such horse armor was the chamfrain, ""helmet"" covering the forehead of the horse. The chamfrain often included slots for the horse's ears to fit through, and blinkers to prevent the horse from shying.","The chalumeau was an unassuming French folk woodwind instrument dating from as early as the 12th century CE. By the 1700s the chalumeau became a popular classical instrument in Germany, where woodwind makers experimented with reshaping the instrument to improve its tone and increase its range. These changes eventually produced the modern clarinet, which rendered the chalumeau obsolete.","The Verneuil process is one of the oldest methods for synthesizing gemstones, developed in 1902 by French chemist Auguste Verneuil. Powdered ingredients are sifted onto a very hot flame, where they fuse together and then drip down onto a base, where they solidify into crystal. Usually used to synthesize corundum, the Verneuil process is also known as the flame fusion process, because the flame is necessary to fuse the ingredients into crystal.","By 1000 CE, horse armor in the Islamic empires of central Asia was primarily metal.

Counterintuitively, blowouts are more likely when a tire is underinflated, rather than overinflated. As a car drives, the sidewalls of its tires bend and flex. When a tire has low pressure, its sidewalls bend more, creating heat that weakens the tire and puts it at risk of blowing out. This explains why blowouts are more common in the summer, when tires are already warmer.","Tire blowouts can be frightening and dangerous.

For everyday driving, these fluctuations do not usually affect performance. However, race cars rely on having very specific tire pressure. Thus, race car tires are inflated with pure nitrogen gas, not air, so they can stay at a constant tire pressure.","Trace amounts of water vapor in air can make tire pressure change unpredictably depending on the temperature of the air, the tires, and the road.
