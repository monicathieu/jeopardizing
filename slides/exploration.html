### Metamemory descriptions: Guess

&gt;I'm very unfamiliar with the New Testament, so I just typed the first biblical name I could think of. I'm almost certain my answer was incorrect, but couldn't think of anything better within the time limit.

&gt;First off, my trivia knowledge is, as you can tell, horrific. But, Yosemite was the first park to come to mind, and I recalled a faint association they had together.

&gt;I vaguely remember hearing Puget Sound in a conversation about west coast locations but not sure

&gt;I mean, I read about the ottoman empire in school. I know the cushioned footstool is called the ottoman. I know put the two together while answering

&gt;orion's belt is one of the few constellations i know. i guess it could be shaped like scales

&gt;I don't know many book review sites with that many members - goodreads is the most famous I can think of (other than amazon which isn't really a book review site, and wasn't founded by these people)

&gt;I did not know what the large flightless bird in South America might be, but I knew that the Emu is a large flightless bird. I couldn't remember where Emus are native to (my instinct had been to say Australia) but because  I couldn't think of another answer, I went with Emu.

&gt;I initially misread the question and saw "important minority...group...in...Iraq," leading my brain to leap to Shi'ites. However, seeing the adjective "ethnic" brought me back to the Kurds, since they live in parts of Turkey and (I think?) Iraq. 30 million seems like a high number but I realize this isn't a topic I'm very knowledgable about, and scanning through other minority ethnic groups of the region didn't bring up anything more plausible, so I submitted the answer.

&gt;I don't follow baseball at all, but I know what the teams on the West Coast are. From these, I know that the Dodgers have recently gone to the World Series, so it seemed a reasonable guess.

---

### Metamemory descriptions: Just Know

&gt;I think I ran out of time on the actual trivia portion of this, since it took me too long to pull the name from memory. I think because I was so focused on trying to generate names of supreme court justices, no particular memories came to mind.

&gt;I've seen an episode. It could also be called Big Little Lies...

&gt;I'm not 100% sure if I got this correct, but I think of national parks and I go to Yellowstone or Yosemite...El Capitan sounds really familiar

&gt;I was going to type Kuwait but it timed out. I thought I just knew this from growing up in Dubai, but I have no memory of where/when I heard it the first time.

&gt;GERSHWIN. I had a tip-of-the-tongue state when the question first came up. But i know this song and have played it many times. No source memory for learning it though

&gt;I play a lot of video games. Many have easter eggs. I know that I have known this fact for years but I don't remember specifically when i learned it.

&gt;The song "Shape of You" is by Ed Sheeran, so for that question I felt I "just knew" the answer. There was not a specific experience that came to mind hearing that song and I don't know when I would have learned any facts about the song.

&gt;I'm embarrassingly rusty on my presidential dates and would have had to count forwards or backwards from a famous election to confirm that William Henry Harrison was elected in 1840, but that short of a term in the 1840s immediately evoked his presidency and I "just know" that Tyler was his VP/successor.

&gt;These facts seem to spring to mind as I read the question, and the memory state is largely the same regardless of the specific question. In the cases where I feel I have to 'dig' for the answer, my mind will often generate supplementary details, or what I think the answer sounds like, but no specific scene is conjured in memory.

---

### Metamemory descriptions: Related Memory

&gt;When I was younger, I remember reading various video game guides that would occasionally mention easter eggs (assuming that was indeed the right answer for this question!). However, I'm not sure exactly when I learned about the definition of the term â€” or if I just figured it out over time via context clues.

&gt;I'm pretty sure my dad and I listened to this on a car trip last year, but I could be 100% off.

&gt;Uranium or plutonium come to mind along with the memory of a former Columbia student who supposedly took a piece of uranium to his room and got caught

&gt;I visited Yosemite, and so definitely know this. But I don't know if I knew it before visiting (feels like I did, but no memories of learning come to mind)

&gt;not applicable


&gt;When i think of Kurds I think of the various wars in the region over the past 30 years and the many news articles describing their displacement.

&gt;For the question about which former N.W.A member went on to star in movies like "Friday," I immediately thought of the popular GIF from the movie Friday which helped me remember Ice Cube was the answer.

&gt;I do confuse the large flightless birds pretty regularily, but "rhea" popped up immediately given South America, as did related memories of giving that answer on trivia questions with the same clue and being rewarded with points--hopefully not a false memory!

&gt;The El Capitan question immediately brings to mind visual memory of Yosemite, which I have visited several times before. Even if I had not, though, I feel I would have been able to answer the question, since El Capitan is pretty famous. In that way, the visual memory and factual memory do not feel particularly tightly bound.

---

### Metamemory descriptions: Learning Memory

&gt;Although I can't pinpoint one particular instance in which I first heard this song, I have many memories of listening to it throughout 2017 (and beyond), while always being aware of who the singer was. Most of these memories took place at bars, given that there was a period of time when you couldn't go out anywhere without hearing this song. Ed Sheeran's voice is relatively distinctive, so I never had to be explicitly told the name of the artist.

&gt;not applicable


&gt;I remember learning about Greek philosophers in my Literature Humanities courses

&gt;It says undefined ... I'm guessing I didn't have any memory in this category.

&gt;I watched this baldwin documentary maybe a year ago (?), and I remember watching it while on the elliptical at my parent's house.

&gt;I remember learning this fact at the time and associating it with thoughts of friends who like David Bowie.

&gt;For the question which scientific classification came between Class and Family, I remember sitting in my 8th grade biology class and learning the taxonomic classifications.

&gt;I remember learning about this show from endless HBO ads I got while watching baseball a few summers ago--unfortunately, I wasn't any more sure which of the "lies" titled shows it was (Pretty Little Liars? Big Little Lies?)--I believe I entered the former but think now it may have been the latter :(

&gt;Although I had known of Andrea Boccelli and heard his music before, I did not know he was blind until relatively recently when he appeared in another trivia context. It was surprising and notable to me since I assume it is the most salient fact most people know about him. In this case, it did help me confirm the answer to the question (although I would have probably guessed Boccelli anyway without that knowledge).
