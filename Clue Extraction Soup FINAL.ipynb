    "# Extracting the Jeopardy Clue Base from J-Archive\n",
    "<b>by Matt Jackson</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dedicated fans of the TV game show <em>Jeopardy!</em> have created a resource called <a href=\"http://j-archive.com/\">J-Archive</a>, which stores the game boards for every game aired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, it's pretty well-formatted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual game is stored on a distinct page where you can view the gameboard \"as-is\", and mouse over each clue to reveal what the correct response was (and which player, if any, rang in to give it). Each game is a page with its own \"game_id\" corresponding to the order in which that game was archived; for example, the finale of Season 32 is at http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=5384 because it was the 5384th game to be archived.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Confusingly, if you go to that page, you see \"Show #7355\", because it was the 7,355th show to <em>air</em> on television. (The game_id number is usually lower than the show number, because many old episodes from early in the show's run are now lost to time and aren't archived at all.)\n"

    "* We also use regular expressions to isolate substrings in cases where we need to drop extraneous information surrounding the data we want to keep for each clue.\n",
    "* Once we've gotten the useful information for each clue, we create a data frame in Pandas to store those clues."
